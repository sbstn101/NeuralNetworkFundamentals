## Forward forward algorithm

The idea of this repository is to use Numpy to recreate the Forward-Forward algorithm introduced by Geoffrey Hinton in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.13345.pdf

I am doing this to learn to understand the algorithm better and to test it's performance against backpropagation on various tasks.

√çn the future I'm planning on expanding this to more complex networks.
